I am Mikhail Zharov and living in Moscow, Russia. I am about 70 years old.
Currently long retired. For many years I worked as a programmer in a bank. 
And only after finishing my active labor activity I feel like a full-fledged 
person when there is time for his favorite hobby: chess, billiards. 
But the passion for solving puzzles remained. 
When I found site CodeWars, I was struck by the abundance of unfamiliar languages.
