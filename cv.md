## Some words about me
I am about 70 years old.
Currently long retired. For many years I worked as a programmer in a bank. 
And only after finishing my active labor activity I feel like a full-fledged 
person when there is time for his favorite hobby: chess, billiards. 
But the passion for solving puzzles remained. 
When I found site CodeWars, I was struck by the abundance of unfamiliar languages.

###
After reading the name of the Kotlin language, it immediately hit me. 
Nostalgic memories of youth about three years in a pea jacket. Kotlin and Kronstadt are inseparable.

## My hobby:

### Chess. 
I am in the beginning of my way. It is very interesting to solve tasks on site lichess.org 
Also I am studying debut theory and playing Fischer chess.

### American pool.
This is a variation of classic billiards, where a lot of time is devoted to difficult strokes. 
Looking at the games of the masters, you see that they also make mistakes 
when calculating the trajectory of a complex blow.

### CodeWars
The abundance of previously unfamiliar programming languages is impressive.
I would like to study them all at once. Plus, my position in the overall standings motivates me personally.
If I may say so. Personally, for myself, I set a goal to get into the first 5 thousand, and subsequently into the first thousand. It is very difficult. In fact, I did not reach the level of 1-2 kyu.
The complexity of tasks of this level is still unattainable for me.
